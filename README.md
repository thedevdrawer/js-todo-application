# JS ToDo Application
Ever wanted to build a to-do application? Let's build it using vanilla JavaScript. In this tutorial, we will use only vanilla JavaScript to build out an application that stores information in the browser using a local session, retrieves it, and displays it with a complete and remove button. We will also create an input that allows you to add new items to the list with the click of a button or by hitting the enter key.

This is a simple tutorial and since I have been learning to use vanilla JS more, I figured I would take what I have learned and put it to use for you. Hopefully, you learn a bit and I hope to do a few more tutorials using vanilla JS soon.
